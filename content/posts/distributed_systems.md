From Iron Age(Bare Metal) Computing to Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems have
played a vital role in processing and delivering information, but we are just
getting started.

We are set to enter [Zetta Byte era](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/vni-hyperconnectivity-wp.html)
with just [40% of total world population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage)
connected to Internet.

Since the inception of Internet, every technology giant is using aspects of
Distributed Systems to achieve high availability and scalability in order to
cater the ever growing service requests.

Distributed Systems have provided basis for Software Architectures like

[CORBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage), [SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage),
[Microservices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage).

Internet of Things which is poised to reach ~ [38 billion devices by 2020](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage),
is further expanding and [evolving Distributed Systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage).

## What are Distributed Systems ?

A Distributed System provides single coherent view of collection of
independent computing machines.
Multiple software components running on multiple computers, running as
single system. Computers can be connected locally or geographically.

## Characteristics of Distributed Systems

- Concurrency
- Fault Tolerance
- Scalability
- Transperancy
- Heterogeneity
- Resource Sharing

## Fallacies of Distributed Computing

- Reliable Network
- Zero Latency
- Infinite Bandwidth
- Secure Network
- Static Topology
- Homogeneous Network
- Single/Central Administration
