Chaos engineering  is the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system, in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.

Following things should be kept in mind while designing a __Chaos Experiment__:

## 1. Pick a Hypothesis

This step involves the selection of hypothesis which is required to be tested.

__For eg:__

* Verifying that terminating/shutting half of the EC2 instances belonging to Auto-Scaling Group of particular service won't cause service outage.

## 2. Identify the metrics to monitor for the experiment

This steps discusses about the metrics which will enable you to evaluate the outcome of the experiment.

__For eg:__

* Terminating half of the instances in Auto-Scaling group of the service might result in the following scenarios:

  - 25% increase in response latency of the service.

  - 30% increase in CPU utilization of existing machines.

## 3. Notify the involved Business Units

This is an important step which discusses about notifying the __Service Business Unit__ so that all the teams around that service are aware of following:

  - What is that you will be performing on the service?
  - Why are you performing it on the service?
  - When you will be peforming it on the service?

## 4. Run the experiment

This step involves to run the chaos experiment and observe the metrics.

If you're running the experiment in the production, ability to abort/stop the experiment could help in preventing unnecessary harm if experiment doesn't execute as per the plan.

## 5. Analyze the results

In this step, you gather the metrics to answer the following question:

* Was the hypothesis correct?
* Was the service resilient to the chaos/failure events that were injected/exposed to it?
* Did anything happen that shouldn't happen?

## 6. Automate the process

Once you've confidence in manually running your chaos experiments, automating the same with scripts and workflow engine can help you run the experiments regularly and automatically.
