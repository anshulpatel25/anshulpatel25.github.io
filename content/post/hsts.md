HSTS is an opt-in security specified by a web application through the use of a special response header.

When the browser receives this header, the browser prevents all communication over HTTP to that specified domain. Instead the browser will send all communication over HTTPS.

## Why HSTS?

HSTS is designed to overcome following threats:

* User bookmarks or manual types like "http://example.com" are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack.

* A web application that is intended to be communicated over HTTPS, contains HTTP links or serves content over HTTP.

* Man-in-the-middle attack which makes victim accept the bad certificate by intercepting network traffic.

## HSTS in Action

* Webserver directive should be added to upgrade all HTTP connections to HTTPS connections on first-time website access.

* Webserver directive to add HSTS header in HTTPS section.

* If the configuration is successful, you will get following 307(Internal Redirect) redirection from the browser.
