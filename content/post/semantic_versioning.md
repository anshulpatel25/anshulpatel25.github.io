Software Versioning makes it easy and convenient to track, test, deploy, patch and rollback features, enhancements and bug/fixes across variety of environments in [Software Supply Chain](https://youtu.be/XM1HRy7aJxE).

Semantic Versioning provides an efficient and effective framework to version the software products, so that the infamous [Dependency Hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell) can be avoided.

# What is Semantic Versioning ?

Semantic Versioning uses MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH number scheme for software products  . For Eg: 2.0.5

# How to decide when to update the version numbers ?

Increment PATCH number during:

* Backward Compatible Bug Fix.
* Backward Compatible Maintenance Release.
* Backward Compatible Hot Fix.

Increment MINOR number during:

* Backward Compatible new Framework Adoption.
* Backward Compatible new Functionality Implementation.
* Backward Compatible Framework Enhancement.
* Backward Compatible Functionality Enhancement.

Note: PATCH should be reset to 0 when MINOR is incremented.

Increment MAJOR number during:

* Any Backward Incompatible change.
* MAJOR zero (0.Y.Z) should be considered for development. Product shouldn't be considered stable and shouldn't be deployed on Production.

Note: PATH, MINOR both should be reset to 0 when MAJOR is incremented.

# What about versioning during Continuous Integrations (CI) ?

Pre-release numbers with Semantic Versioning can tackle the problem of versioning during CI.

For Eg: X.Y.Z-${CI_BUILD_NUMBER}, 2.0.5-1992

Once the software product is ready for prime time, pre-release number should be removed and product should be published/released to external repository.

Note: Once the package is released/published, it MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.
