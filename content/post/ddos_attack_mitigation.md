[2016 saw 71%](http://www.akamai.com/us/en/multimedia/documents/state-of-the-internet/q3-2016-state-of-the-internet-security-report-infographic.pdf) rise in Denial of Service attacks with biggest attack of 623 Gbps and mega attacks averaging around 100 Gbps. If unprepared, Denial of Service can result in [Financial losses, Reputational Damage, Customer Attrition and Legal Pursuits](http://blog.radware.com/security/2013/05/how-much-can-a-ddos-attack-cost-your-business/).

## Common Denial of Service Attacks

### HTTP Flood Attacks

* **Volumetric Attack:** Simultaneously many machines launch HTTP requests towards a target, saturating it's resources or saturating bandwidth.
* **Malicious Application Requests:** Simultaneous GET/POST/PUT requests to target, which causes high CPU utilization. For Eg: Password Reset request, Long running requests like report execution, downloading large files, requests calling slow hash function

### SYN Attacks

* Simultaneous TCP requests are sent to target, but doesn't complete 3-way handshake. For Eg: Initiating request via Spoofed IP.


### UDP and ICMP Attacks

* Simultaneously flood random ports on target using UDP protocol.
Spoofing is much easier as there is no 3-way handshake in UDP.


### ICMP Attacks

* Simultaneously launching ICMP echo requests to the target with spoofed IP.
* Simultaneously sending large packets to the target causing buffer-overflow.

### DNS Attack Reflection and Amplification

* DNS reflection is achieved by eliciting a response from a DNS resolvers to a spoofed IP.
Simultaneously sending out DNS query with a spoofed IP to a DNS resolver can overwhelm it.


## Basic Mitigations

* Establish Traffic reputation
* Filter Ingress traffic
* Disable unused ports and block unnecssary protocols
* Blackholing suspected or malicious traffic
* Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
* Use third-party services like CloudFlare, Akamai, Incapsula.
